Bringing a measuring tape with you is a good idea anyways to doublecheck they what you need anywhere."

Among other things, I’ve ordered 14 plasterboards of the 1200x2500 size to be delivered home. A few days before the planned delivery, I got notified that those plasterboards were out of stock, despite a much bigger quantity being available in the system when I placed the order. That was annoying enough, as I specifically chose to have home delivery, so I wouldn’t have to rent a trailer and deal with it myself. Other things that I ordered didn’t have the right quantity and were damaged during transport. Luckily, that issue was promptly dealt with. However, it is 3 weeks after I got the notification about the 14 plasterboards being out of stock (2 weeks after the delivery) and I still haven’t received my money back! This is absolutely unacceptable. Complete disorganisation and lack of respect for the customers. Do not shop in Byggmax!"

Would like to benefit businesses in the municipality, but in this case you get better service on e.g. large chains such as in Arninge. Shame, would be happy to pay extra to get good service locally.

Daniel Qviberg really does a great job as project manager at the company. He is responsive and has a good ability to both listen to requests and come up with suggestions on how he thinks we can achieve the best results in terms of budget. The carpenter Kenneth has worked there all 10 years and is great to have with us.\n\nQviberg Bygg is not the cheapest, which is not their ambition either. However, they are professionals, show up on time, do what they have to do and tune in, ask questions and come up with suggestions for solutions when needed.\n\nI recommend them for both large and small projects. We have hired them for the complete renovation of an apartment, stairwell carpentry, site-built carpentry, carpentry of a contemporary chest panel, tiling in the hall, as well as ordinary interior carpentry. Rigging and construction of roofs and walls etc. The company really shines when it comes to fine joinery and finishes. The carpenters have been super professional throughout, but radiated genuine job satisfaction during these fine carpentry works."

Now temporarily fixed, the machine can be used and a spare part ordered. Very pleased!!!"

They forgot to remove the transit bolts from the machine (see picture) or did it on purpose and did not inform me about it. These bolts are used to stop the drum unit inside from moving during transportation. A professional should know about this...\n\nWhen I switched on the machine, the strong vibrations broke the support they had built to fit the machine in the kitchen cabinet, that was not good in the first place.\n\nI then had to disconnect the pipes, remove the machine from the cabinet, open it up, remove the transit bolts, build a better support and put everything back in place. Luckily my dad was around to help.\n\nWhen I complained about the quality of the work done I received no answer. Then, almost two months after, I received an invoice for more than 5.000 SEK. I questioned the amount and their answer was that the only thing they had to take care of was the water connection. This is a lie, I asked them to take care of everything needed to fit the washing machine in the kitchen. In any case, since they did more than just connecting the water pipes, they should be accountable for the way this was done.\n\nBottom line: worst customer service ever and dangerous way of working. If I hadn't realised those bolts were still in place, I would have damaged the machine and the kitchen furniture.\n\nI know finding someone to help with handy work in Stockholm is hard but my strong suggestion is to look elsewhere."

She did not provide our table with glasses while all the other tables had one.\n\nI ordered pad Thai with an extra fried egg on top. My food did not come with the extra egg and she refused to take it off the bill.

So far I’ve liked the place since they have quite democratic pricing. I’d only consider it for food to go, since the place is super small, no WC, and it’s super cold (unless it’s summer). However, today much changed for me since I faced quite a disrespectful situation. It was my first time coming for lunch (which is cheaper than usual), and what I got was obviously a much smaller portion, which they tried to hide (!) by putting 3 big pieces of lemon to fill the space in the box (they normally put one, and the portion fills the whole box). Thus, this “lunch offer” was just a lie. This is not a big deal in terms of money, but a big deal when it comes to how they treat customers."

The hot n spicy is also perfect. But the three things that scores big time are the things that we like the most.\n\n1. Speed! You get your food in a jiffy no matter the que or order!\n\n2. Size! As a grown man you can EASILY! split the lunch with someone or save for the next day. You wont go hungry to the desk. You will sleep on the keyboard...AGAIN!\n\n3. Price! The price is a s we speak 87kr! For a mega portion. And if you are a student its like 55kr(!)\n\nI really recommend this place. Its forth the walk .Try it!! 🍜"

Plenty of fresh lime wedges in the som tam.\nThe rice was bad.  Overcooked and mushy.\n\nToo bad the staff hadn't cleaned the table after previous guests (rice on the tablecloth) and for some reason they cranked up the stereo an hour before closing time when guests were still eating and trying to have conversations.\n\nI won't be back."
